The goal of the lab is to find the optimum path between two territories based on the
constraints of soldiers on the starting territory and how many soldiers you have to “knock off”
between the two territories from the popular game Risk using the World map.

The connections of the territories are stored in a CSV file which you will need to load in. You will
then prompt the user for a path which they wish to chart(from and to) along with how many
soldiers are going to be on the starting spot. You will then let them know if it’s possible to do
this(show the path) and if not let them know what’s the farthest you got. When charting out a
path the tiebreaker between two equal paths would less stops. You can assume that the
casualty rate is 1:1
Finally, you need to determine what’s the least amount of moves needed to reach every city,
for this question you can assume an unlimited supply of soldiers.

For City,
price is the total route to get to a territory and the HashMap<City, double> does not make sense as a variable as connections.
When you do relaxxing thing, I go to the territory with the least amount of soldiers.
Remove the HashMap and instead get HashSet because there is no cost, it is already associated in the City.



Make sure you keep track of the path.
In the end, you will assess if you have enough soldiers to go through the path.

Let them input the amount of soldiers they want to sends
