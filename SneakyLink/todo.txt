Find a data set which requires continuous access to its elements using non-index keys with at least 100
elements.

Create a hashcode function that minimizes collision and demonstrate that fewer than 10 collisions occur
in this data set. The function must be easy enough to perform by a human with a calculator.


The CustomHashMap will have the following methods:
put(Entry&lt;Key,Value&gt;)
get(Key)
remove(Key)
put(i, Entry&lt;Key,Value&gt;) //places the Entry into a specific spot to demonstrate collision
loadFactor()
rehash()

toString (will provide a summary of the elements and load factor)
loadFromFile(File)




The collisions will be handled with a linked list
Create A Driver that will load in the file and have an interface from the user to get, put, and remove
elements from the data base. If the put creates a collision OUTPUT THAT ON THE ON SCREEN.
