App:
After loading the tree (based on a file provided by the user)
The trie will be constructed from a text file with words/phrases in a single column 
The goal of the lab is to auto complete a user’s typing after constructing a trie from an
alphabet.

AutoComplete:
Will load a text file first, make a Trie out of it
and then ask the user for options to 1: add 2: delete 3:AutoComplete 4: Compress 5: print inorder

Options:
3. Display the tree ( Each Node can display it’s children) line by line toString()
5. Autocomplete (show all possible ways to finish from a prefix, if a prefix doesn’t exist say “no
such word”) auto(String)
6. Check if a word is a key isKey(String)

Ask:
4. Compress (a single chain will be rolled up to a single String) after this you can’t add anymore
compress()
