The goal of the lab is to auto complete a user’s typing after constructing a trie from an
alphabet.

The trie will be constructed from a text file with words/phrases in a single column

Three classes needs to be created. 
The third class will be called AutoComplete which will load a text file first, make a Trie out of it
and then ask the user for options to 1: add 2: delete 3:AutoComplete 4: Compress 5: print
inorder

Is this graphics?

After loading the tree (based on a file provided by the user)
You will need to have the following options


3. Display the tree ( Each Node can display it’s children) line by line toString()
4. Compress (a single chain will be rolled up to a single String) after this you can’t add anymore
compress()
5. Autocomplete (show all possible ways to finish from a prefix, if a prefix doesn’t exist say “no
such word”) auto(String)
6. Check if a word is a key isKey(String)
