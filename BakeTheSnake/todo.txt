You should have a class called Snake which will have the direction and integer coordinates
(corresponding to a 2D plane with 0,0 being the top left) as well as the reference to the next
Body piece.
The Body piece would just have the location and reference to the next Body. Which will be
structured like a linked list of Locations. Do not use the LinkedList built by java but instead
create your own.
The default snake will start at 4,4 and will have body pieces on 4,3 and 4,2 facing South
Make sure to create an all parameter constructor too
The Snake class will also have to be able to have the following methods
boolean update(String commands) returns whether or not the snake is still alive based on the
commands given. The commands will be

M – move in the direction you’re facing
U – change the direction to be Up same for (D,L,R)
F – ate a fruit eating a fruit will result in the next Move command moving the Snake and
inserting a new Body piece where the Head piece was
E – ate an egg eating an egg would remove every other body starting with the first Body piece
with the other body pieces filling the void one by 1. (I made this one up so enjoy)





boolean update(char c) - executes a single command
int getSize() – returns the size of the snake including the head
boolean isAlive() returns if the snake is still alive
void reverse() flips the snake so that the tail becomes the head and all the nodes change
pointers. Should be the opposite direction.
String toString() will draw the snake in a 2D board. If the snake is dead you should draw the
final state of the snake

IMPORTANT!
Finally create a Tester BEFORE BUILDING THE CODE. Which will have expected output results.
Include 3 test scenarios for each. Submit that first.
