The goal is to connect all of the islands by drawing a series of bridges between the islands. The
bridges must follow certain criteria: [2]
1. They must begin and end at distinct islands, travelling a straight line in between.
2. They must not cross any other bridges or islands.
3. They may only run orthogonally (i.e. they may not run diagonally).
4. At most two bridges connect a pair of islands.
5. The number of bridges connected to each island must match the number on that island.
6. The bridges must connect the islands into a single connected group.



You will need to load in a file with a potential solution and then run the checks below to confirm that
it’s solved. You will need to make a graph out of it first and display the vertices and edges.

Then check the rules that every out degree for the node is equal to the value as well as that the
graph is connected.

If either of the above stipulation is not met, CLEARLY identify which islands don’t have the
numbers matched up and identify the clusters of islands that are disjoint.
