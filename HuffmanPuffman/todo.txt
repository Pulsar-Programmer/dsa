The goal of the lab is efficiently encode a textile using the Huffman Encoding strategy

Then create a frequency table which will be using to create the Huffman Encoding for every
character based on the frequency.
Create a huffman encoding table for every character thatâ€™s in the article
Display the table
Then encode it and output the file.
You also need to decode anything using the encoding created from an article

Set up the driver to take in a file that has the text and then encode it.

Then ask to decode something using the coding strategy you developed (could be the output
file you created when encoding)
