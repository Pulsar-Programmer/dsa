The goal of the lab is efficiently encode a text file using the Huffman Encoding strategy

Read in an article as a text file character by character creating a HashMap of the characters and
their frequency which will be using to create the Huffman Encoding for every character based
on the frequency.

In the driver, ask the user for the file and create a huffman encoding table for every character
thatâ€™s in the article
Display the table
Then encode it and output the file.
Then ask the user to decode a file using the encoding created from an article (could be the
output file you created when encoding)
