The goal of the lab is to demonstrate how Radix Sort sorts integers in linear time.


The elements should be presented as boxes with an integer inside which will be split and
recombined based on the individual digits until the elements are sorted. The integers should be
loaded in from a csv file and can be assumed to be in base 10 and that there will be less than 50
and will be non-negative.



Both the MSD and LSD Radix sort must be demonstrated (the user can choose this), the
numbers will then start to distribute and recombine.



All inputs (including the name of the input file) needs to be through a GUI. No inputs outputs in
the system.
Be creative with the animation of the split. Include a slider for the animation speed.
